## **NotFound** - This error is raised when the specified path does not exist, typically during attempts to access or manipulate it, but also potentially when trying to create a directory and a parent directory does not exist.
##
## **PermissionDenied** - Occurs when the user lacks the necessary permissions to perform an action on a directory, such as reading, writing, or executing.
##
## **Other** - A catch-all for any other types of errors not explicitly listed above.

## Deletes a directory if it's empty
##
## This may fail if:
##   - the path doesn't exist
##   - the path is not a directory
##   - the directory is not empty
##   - the user lacks permission to remove the directory.

## Recursively deletes the directory as well as all files and directories
## inside it.
##
## This may fail if:
##   - the path doesn't exist
##   - the path is not a directory
##   - the directory is not empty
##   - the user lacks permission to remove the directory.

## Creates a directory
##
## This may fail if:
##   - a parent directory does not exist
##   - the user lacks permission to create a directory there
##   - the path already exists.
